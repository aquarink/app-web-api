Blitzkrieg-API
=====================================

How to install to production:
- Deploy this application to server production (example: /home/user/blitzkrieg-api)
    As alternative, we can easily git clone ssh://dev1@103.10.131.191/~/repositories/blitzkrieg-api instead
- Download play framework 2.0.2 from http://download.playframework.org/releases/play-2.0.2.zip
- Extract play framework
- Make sure PATH also point to the play framework directory (example: export PATH="${PATH}:/home/user/play-2.0.2") put it into your ~/.bash_profile
- cd ~/blitzkrieg-api
- setup/config your application
    create config/application.conf (you can copy it from conf/application.default.conf)
    and configure it properly (such as database url, etc.)
- to run as development/test/trial, type
    play "run 9000"
- to run as production, type
    play "start 9000"
    (this will produce application monitor log, which will fork background the apps and you can easily Ctrl-D to continue process to the background)
